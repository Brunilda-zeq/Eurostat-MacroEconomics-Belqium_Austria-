In this study it will be presented how machine learning methodologies could be applied in economics and finance and it will also be demonstrated how economic forecasts can be generated using various methodologies. More specifically Austria and Belgium are the countries examined in this analysis and in which these methods will be applied.
The data was obtained from Eurostat, and some 'data cleaning' was required in order to do this research. Outliers were corrected, NA values were eliminated or rectified, and lastly Seasonalities, if they existed, were corrected to make the variables stationary in order to be able to apply some methodologies and make the results more reliable before the study began.
This study's goals include a better understanding of the variables through statistical indicators and visualization, variable selection, and the creation of cross validation forecasts for some of the indicators. To achieve these objectives, a number of models will be utilized, including ARMA, PCA, PLS, Ridge, Lasso, and k â€“ means clustering models. All methods are applied in real data using the R Project for Statistical Analysis as the main scientific software.
So, let's get started!
